## Current state
- Player can walk around test world and look at rooms content. Cool!

## Changelog
- Processing user input,
- Keywords detection,
- Room roads introduced,
- Player moving on roads,


## Todo
- [ ] strip spaces from end of user input,
- [ ] room iterator not working with pointer array (see system_user_input 'go'),
- [ ] some option to wrap words for preset display width, center text, draw boxes, option butlabels (yes/no),

## Ideas
- [ ] Long text from game/narrator - hang game, press enter to continue,
- [ ] Enemy/boss room - combat stage + dialogs to choose actions like attack, use object (lever, climb...),
